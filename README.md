# Social Network Analysis with Python

> Social network analysis (SNA) is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information/knowledge entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups while the links show relationships or flows between the nodes. SNA provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them. Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread, information circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working relationships, social networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships. These networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.

## General Information
In this repository, I have shown the usage of Social Network Analysis in real-life scenarios. NetworkX library is used for demonstrating the usage. Below are the notebooks:
- [Creating Features using NetworkX for prediction](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Creating%20Features%20using%20NetworkX%20for%20prediction.ipynb)
- [Extracting Features from Graph](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Extracting%20Features%20from%20Graph.ipynb)
- [Graphs in NetworkX](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Graphs%20in%20NetworkX.ipynb)
- [Manipulating Graphs in NetworkX](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Manipulating%20Graphs%20in%20NetworkX.ipynb)
- [Network Centrality](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Network%20Centrality.ipynb)
- [Network Connectivity](https://github.com/kampaitees/Social-Network-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Network%20Connectivity.ipynb)

## Technologies Used
- Lanugage - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Library 1 - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
- Library 2 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Library 3 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- Library 4 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- Web Interface - [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)

## Setup
### What things you need to install the software and how to install them

#### Following are the dependencies of python which you have to install in your system
 ``` 
  - python 3.6.8 
  - python pip 
 ```
#### After installing python and pip you have to just write  
 
    pip install 'below dependencides'
 
#### To install below dependencies:
 ```
  - numpy==1.18.5
  - pandas==1.1.0
  - networkx==1.11
  - matplotlib==3.0.3
  - jupyter lab
 ```

After installing the above library you have to launch the jupyter lab and run the notebook which you want to run.

## Usage
Social Network Analysis helps in organizational network analysis, 
understanding networks and their participants, evaluating the location of actors in the network, measuring the network location. It is a practical method that can reliably monitor the interactions in an online PBL environment. For example, using SNA could reveal important information about the course, the group, and individual students. The insights generated by SNA may be useful in the context of learning analytics to help monitor studentsâ€™ activity.

## Acknowledgements
The notebooks of the repository are a part of the course [Applied Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis). This course will introduce the learner to network analysis through tutorials using the NetworkX library. The course begins with an understanding of what network analysis is and motivations for why we might model phenomena as networks. The second week introduces the concept of connectivity and network robustness. The third week will explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. The final week will explore the evolution of networks over time and cover models of network generation and the link prediction problem. This course should be taken after: Introduction to Data Science in Python, Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, and Applied Machine Learning in Python.
